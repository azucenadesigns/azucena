          <p>
            Cairn Terrier Dog Profile - History, Personality, Health, Training The Cairn Terrier dog breed
            is a small working terrier developed on the Isle of Skye in Scotland. Farmers used them to rid
            their property of vermin.
          </p>
          <p class="panel">
            Small dog owners unite! These little rascals are a big deal because not only are they undeniably
            adorable, they’re also easier to own. Small dogs are favored by many because they tend to be easier
            to bathe, walk, feed, and care for than their larger (though equally lovable) counterparts.
            Among the small dog breeds, a few stand out.

          <h4>Benefits of Golden Retriever</h4>
          <p>
            Whether you have a dark golden retriever puppy or you prefer red golden retriever pups,
            there’s no denying that having dogs in the home can provide great benefits to your family.
            While you might think owning golden retriever puppies simply makes life a bit more fun, studies
            have found that dogs can actually improve your overall well-being.


          </p>
          <p class="panel">
            One of the top benefits of owning golden retriever puppies is their ability to improve your mental
            health. Dog owners have been found to have reduced levels of anxiety and depression thanks to the
            comfort and companionship provided by their pet. The simple act of playing with a dark golden retriever
            puppy can have a significant calming effect, which can lower blood pressure. There are other benefits
            to having a dog in the house, especially when it comes to your physical health. Golden retriever
            puppies are naturally playful, and taking them on walks or enjoying other forms of healthy play will
            ultimately help you fit exercise into your schedule. Many people successfully lose weight just
            by walking their dog!

          <h4>Great Dane</h4>
          <p>
            The Great Dane's massive head is narrow and flat on top. The eyebrows are prominent. The ears drop
            forward or are cropped to stand erect. The neck is long and strong. The Great Dane's body is long,
            muscular and the front legs are straight. The tail is medium in length; it is thick at the base and
            tapers down to below the hocks.Great Danes are light to average shedders. The coat is short and sleek
            and comes in a variety of colors including brindle or fawn, blue, black or harlequin, which has black
            patches over a white background.
          </p>
          <p class="panel">
            Great Danes are considered gentle giants. They are moderately playful, affectionate and good with
            children. They will guard their home. Great Danes generally get along with other animals, particularly
            if raised with them, but some individuals in the breed can be aggressive with dogs they do not know. 
            Great Danes are considered easy to train, but some Great Dane fanciers say that individuals can be
            stubborn learners.

          <h4>Mini Labradoodle</h4>
          <p>
            It’s not surprising that the Labradoodle has gained such popularity so quickly. Originally developed to be hypoallergenic guide dogs, the first planned crosses of Poodles and Labrador Retrievers were arranged by the Royal Guide Dogs Association of Australia.

            The result was a smart and sociable dog who not only possessed a nature appropriate for guide dogs but also had a low-shedding coat. While the hybrid is not yet achieving consistent results in coat or temperament, they’re wildly popular and affectionate dogs.
            
            
          </p>
          <p class="panel">
            The Labradoodle is an intelligent dog who can make the ideal family pet if properly trained. They are friendly and accept and treat everyone like their best friend. They're devoted to their family and enjoy life as an energetic companion.

            They can be gentle, but they can also be joyful, showing their happiness through exuberant jumping and playing. They also tend to be easygoing, since the Labradoodle was bred not to be aggressive. As is the case with any breed, some aren't all that friendly, but a well-trained Labradoodle with a characteristic temperament is a true joy.

          <h4>Pitbull Owners</h4>
          <p>
            The Pit Bull immediately strikes one as being a dog of power, passion and undying willingness. The brick-like head, which is especially broad between the cheeks (to house the powerful jaws), is carried upon a thickly muscled, well-defined neck. The neck runs into a deep, thick, well-sprung chest. The American Pit Bull is a very muscular, stocky, yet agile dog that is extremely strong for his size.The tail tapers to a point. The ears are generally cropped, though this is optional.
          </p>
          <p class="panel">
            Docked tails are not accepted by the UKC or the ADBA. The eyes are round. Both the ADBA and the UKC do not accept blue eyes or the coat color merle. The American Pitbull Registry does accept a merle coat. The teeth should form a scissors bite. Its coat is made up of thick, short, shiny hair. All colors are admissible. Shades of brown to red with a matching red/brown nose are referred to as red-nose Pit Bulls. Shades of gray with a matching gray nose are referred to as blue-nose Pit Bulls.

          <h4>The Most Expensive Breeds</h4>
          <p>
            Native to China and Nepal, the Tibetan Mastiff is an ancient breed that was developed to guard
            flocks and households against wolves and leopards. Tibetan Mastiffs are also among the largest dog breeds in the world,
            with males weighing up to 160 pounds.

            The Czechoslovakian Wolfdog is Czechoslovakia’s national dog. However, it is incredibly rare, explaining why it is so expensive.

            The Czechoslovakian Wolfdog came about in 1955 when working line German Shepherds were crossed with Carpathian wolves. The aim was to create a breed with the intelligence of the German Shepherd and the pack mentality and stamina of wolves.
